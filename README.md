# Internship test

I am by no means used to setting up new projects, so there are likely to be issues in that regard, like long delays.

I used an existing repository as a base for the frontend to reduce the setup needed: https://github.com/danpaul/web_development_2_demo_code. This is the same repository my school provided for an earlier vue + php project.

13:07 - Started

18:01 - Continued work

I realised too late that database columns are usually snake_case, and it would take too much time to replace it now.
I am also not the greatest at creating database structures that connect with eachother, as such, reviews can be made for nonexistent dishes and deleting a dish does not delete reviews.
