# Internship test

I am by no means used to setting up new projects, so there are likely to be issues in that regard, like long delays.

I used an existing repository as a base for the frontend to reduce the setup needed: https://github.com/danpaul/web_development_2_demo_code. This is the same repository my school provided for an earlier vue + php project.
